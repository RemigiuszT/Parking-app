# Parking App Documentation

## Introduction

This application demonstrates a complete solution for managing parking areas and calculating parking fees, built as per the requirements outlined in the RavenDB Work Assignment. It consists of four main views to handle different functionalities of the app.

### Application Views

1. **Main Screen (Home)**  
   Provides an overview of the application. This screen includes a description of the app's functionality and purpose, which is to manage parking areas and compute fees based on time, rates, and discounts.

2. **Parking Areas List**  
   Displays a list of all existing parking areas. Each areaâ€™s weekday and weekend rates, along with any discounts, are shown here. This view offers a quick summary of all available parking spaces in the system.

3. **Parking Area Management**  
   Allows users to add, edit, and delete parking areas. For each area, the following properties are managed:

   - **Name**: The name of the parking area.
   - **Weekday Rate (USD)**: Hourly rate during weekdays.
   - **Weekend Rate (USD)**: Hourly rate on weekends.
   - **Discount**: A percentage discount applied to the computed parking fee.

4. **Payment Calculator**  
   This view allows users to calculate the parking fee for a selected area. It considers:
